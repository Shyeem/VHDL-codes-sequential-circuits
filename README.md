# VHDL-codes-sequential-circuits

This project contains all of the VHDL codes for sequential circuits that I have practiced.
The outputs of the codes are as follows and the codes are provided in the respective repositories.

## Counter (8 bit)
#### need TB code

## D flip-flop
#### [using all conditional methods(wait (no reset), wait (synchronous reset) , asynchronous reset, asynchronous reset with enable)]
